    <h1>My Favourite Food</h1>

    <p>
      My favourite food is
      <a href="https://shorturl.at/opBJS" target="_blank">Poutine.</a>
      This is because poutine is a combination of some of my favourite foods:
      fries and cheese. Together, they create a crispy and creamy texture which
      boasts an enormous amount of flavour.

    <h2>My Favourite Sport</h2>

      My favourite sport is
      <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en" target="_blank">Soccer.</a>
      I love soccer as it was the first sport I ever played. I especially how
      complex the game can be, especially with tactics and managers at the
      highest level, while retaining its core simplicity and minimal
      requirements. Furthermore, watching players like Messi dominate the field
      with their plays made me love the game even more.

    <p>
      My favourite show is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Clover" target="_blank">
        Black Clover</a
      >. Here are some reasons why I like Black Clover:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The action scenes are creatively animated and are drawn very well,
        making every move enjoyable to watch.
      </li>
      <li>
        The plot is interesting and original, centering around the journey of
        one who was born without magic in a society where magic is everything.
      </li>
      <li>
        The writing is also high quality, and all characters act according to
        their natures and don't feel as if they are nothing but plot devices.
